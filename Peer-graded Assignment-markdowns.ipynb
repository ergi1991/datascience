    "# My experience is scattered in various industries such as: consultancy, telecommunication and information technology. I have undertaken data analysis responsibilities in the domains of IT software management, contract management and financial operations and I'm familiar with Microsoft Excel, VBA, SQL, Python and Tableau. I also have a short project management experience in the domain of audio quality assurance for Alexa AI training. Additionally, in my beginnings I got the opportunity to learn and practice some software development skills in Python and XML, while working to enhance an ERP system called Odoo, formerly OpenErp. With that said, I consider myself a valuable resource for companies willing to embrace and benefit from digital transformation projects, able to contribute with my knowledge, both from technical and managerial standpoints."
